My final project for CSCI 567
Recommended user that I've made:
username: testuser@gmail.com
pass: Aa98064203
If you press the button in the map your marker should get registered onto the google map
but you have to go to userpage first and then back to the map to see your added marker.
Same process if you press the button to remove your marker from the map.

Note:
You can access these accounts and turn off their markers to verify they are 
deleted from the map on button press.

There are three markers connected to three users 
-user1@gmail.com
-user2@gmail.com
-user3@gmail.com
all using password: Aa98064203
